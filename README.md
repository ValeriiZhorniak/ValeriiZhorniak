- 👋 Hi, I’m @ValeriiZhorniak.
- 👀 I’m interested in creating websites surpassing myself every time using new technologies.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the basics in the front end. I study preprocessors, basic tools for working with the site, java script and in the future I will master the framework.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate with any company or group of people who can give me a job and new knowledge.
